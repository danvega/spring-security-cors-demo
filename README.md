CORS is an HTTP header-based mechanism that lets you specify in a flexible way what kind of cross-domain requests should be authorized. You will learn how to configure CORS in a Spring Boot application at a controller, method, and global level. You will also learn what to configure when you bring Spring Security into your application.
